# Introduction
This is my little corner, something I've been wanting to make for a while but never got around to doing. I chose GitHub Pages because it allowed me to do everything in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), which appealed to the minimalist in me.

I am a chronic geek, which should be evident from the information I post here.

## Work Life
I am currently working for [Telenor Digital](https://www.telenordigital.com) on the [Appear.in](https://appear.in) project. Prior to Appear.in, I worked on the Comoyo View video-on-demand product until it was canceled in September 2013.

I worked at Trolltech AS, later Trolltech ASA, from 2000 until the Nokia acquisition in 2008. I continued with Nokia until 2012 when I left to join Telenor Digital. During this time I worked on the [Qt Project](http://qt-project.org).

## Personal Life
I am a Texan American expat living in Norway. I was born and raised in [Amarillo, Texas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarillo,_Texas). I moved to Norway in May 2000 at the age of 22 after accepting a job offer from Trolltech AS, and have been in Norway since.
