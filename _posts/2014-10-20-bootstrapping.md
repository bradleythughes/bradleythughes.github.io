title: Bootstrapping bradleythughes.github.io
---

A few days ago, I created a personal [GitHub Pages repository](https://github.com/bradleythughes/bradleythughes.github.io) with a minimal skeleton. It felt good. I had been wanting to do it for a while. However, it didn't have any content, until now.

## Jekyll
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) itself was easy to install and get started with; just follow the docs and you're good to go. However, the geek in me wanted to go one tiny step further than the default install. I created an `index.md` file and wrote the index in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) instead of HTML. This felt more natural, given that posts are written in Markdown. It also allowed me to easily include the full content of the most recent post in the index. I like that.

## Where to now?
Now I need to write. I intend to write about technology, programming, photography, and more, but I'm unsure where to begin. At least I have time to think about it. :)
