# Bootstrapping bradleythughes.github.io
I finally got around to creating a personal [GitHub Pages repository](https://github.com/bradleythughes/bradleythughes.github.io) with a minimal skeleton, but I didn't put any content up. Until now.

## Jekyll
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) itself was easy to install and get started with; just follow the docs and you're good to go. However, the geek in me wanted to go one tiny step further than the default install. I created an `index.md` file and wrote the index in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) instead of HTML. This felt more natural, given that posts are written in Markdown. It also allowed me to easily include the full content of the most recent post in the index. I like that.

## Where to now?
Now I need to create content. I intend to write about technology, programming, photography, and more. I'm unsure where to begin, though. Feel free to send me suggestions.
